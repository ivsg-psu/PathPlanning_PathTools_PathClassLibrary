% fcn_Path_convertTraversalXYtoSy
% Given a reference traversal and a set of stations along that traversal,
% finds the location on each nearby traversal that is closest to the central
% traveral at each station point. Closest is defined via an orthogonal
% projection (or modifications of orthogonal projections) from the central
% traversal outward toward nearby traversals. The results are then
% presented as an array of lateral offsets.
%
% The process to calculate the results is to project orthogonally from the
% reference traversal outward, depending on the flag type, to find the
% intersection from the reference traversal to other traversals. These
% intersections are then used to calculate lateral offsets.
%
% NOTE: this is not a function to convert from XY to Station coordinates,
% as it does not work for all possible XY positions. It will only work for
% very specific orthogonal projections.
%
% NOTE: this is just a reformulation of the function:
% fcn_Path_FindOrthogonalHitFromTraversalToTraversal
% The main difference is the final plotting result, but otherwise it uses
% the same functionality.

% FORMAT:

%      [closestXs, closestYs, closestDistances] = ...
%        fcn_Path_convertTraversalXYtoSy(...
%        reference_station_points, reference_traversal, all_traversals,...
%        (flag_rounding_type),(search_radius),(fig_num));
%
% INPUTS:
%
%      reference_station_points: an N x 1 vector containing the stations on
%      the reference_traversal where the orthogonal projections should take
%      place
%
%      reference_traversal: a traversal structure that specifies the
%      traversal where projections to other traversals are taking place.
%
%      all_traversals: a traversals type data structure containing a cell
%      array of traversal structures that specifies the traversals where
%      intersections from the reference_traversal would hit.
%
%      (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%      flag_rounding_type: a flag to indicate which type of projection is
%      used, especially when stations are located at the end-points of
%      segments within the nearby_traversal. Note that the very first point
%      always uses projections from the following segement, and the very
%      last point always uses the prior. The flag determines behaviors for
%      endpoints of internal segments. The options include:
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 1;  % This is the default, and indicates
%          that the orthogonal projection of an endpoint is created by the
%          PRIOR segment leading up to each station query point.
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 2;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projection of an endpoint is created by the FOLLOWING segment
%          after each station query point.
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 3;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projection, ONLY if the station query falls at the joining point
%          between two segments (e.g. is on the "joint"), then the
%          projection is created by averaging the vector projections
%          created from the PRIOR segment and FOLLOWING segment.
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 4;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projections along segments should be calculated at the midpoints
%          of each segment, and then for each station qeuary, the vector
%          projections are interpolated from their prior and subsequent
%          vectors. Note that this can generate non-orthogonal results.
%
%      search_radius: how far in station distance for the search points to
%      look (default is 3 times the differences in station lengths within
%      all_traversals )
%
%      fig_num: a figure number to plot results.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%      closestXs:  a NxM vector containing the [X] location of
%      the nearest points at the N stations projected orthogonally to the M
%      trajectories with all_traversals
%
%      closestYs:  a NxM vector containing the [Y] location of
%      the nearest points at the N stations projected orthogonally to the M
%      trajectories with all_traversals
%
%      closestDistancess:  a NxM vector containing the distance of
%      the nearest points at the N stations projected orthogonally to the M
%      trajectories with all_traversals. Note that positive distances are
%      those whose cross product from the reference_trajectory to the
%      intersection is positive, negative distances are in the opposite
%      direction

%      2022_01_07:
%      -- edited header to rename:

%      2023_04_30:
%      -- improved plotting by showing XY and Sy side-by-side
