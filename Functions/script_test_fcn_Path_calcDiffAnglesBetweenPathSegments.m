% Tests fcn_Path_calcDiffAnglesBetweenPathSegments
       
% Revision history:
% 2021_01_03
% - first write of the code
% 2021_01_07
% - fixed typos in the comments, minor header clean-ups
% 2025_08_02 by S. Brennan
% - In script_test_fcn_Path_calcDiffAnglesBetweenPathSegments
%   % * added edgeLengths to variable testing
%   % * renamed other variables to match inputs
%   % * added a trival but problem test case from real-world data
