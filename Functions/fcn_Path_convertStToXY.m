% fcn_Path_convertStToXY
% Given a path used to define Station-transverse (St) coordinates, this
% function converts St coordinates into XY cartesian coordinates
%
% The solution method is as follows:
%  1. Find the closest point on the path to the query point
%  2. Find path points behind and ahead of the closest point from step 1
%   -> Check for end cases. For start/end, use the adjacent points.
%  3. Find percentage of travel on both the segments using dot products
%  4. Find projected point on the segment that has percentage of travel
%  between 0 and 1
%  5. If percentage of travel is not between 0 and 1 for both the segments,
%  then choose the snap point as closest point, e.g. the result from step.
%  For this special case, if the point is not clearly orthogonal to the
%  path (which can happen at endpoints for flag types other than 4), it
%  calculates the imaginary portion which is the orthogonal distance to the
%  point as measured from the unit orthogonal projection from the path.

% INPUTS:
%
%      point: a 1x2 vector containing the [X Y] location of the point or
%             a 1x3 vector containing the [X Y Z] location of the point
%
%      path: a Nx2 or Nx3 vector of [X Y (Z)] path points, where N is the
%      number of points the points on the path, with N >= 2.
%
%      (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%      flag_rounding_type: a flag to indicate which type of projection is
%      used, especially when stations are located at the end-points of
%      segments within the nearby_traversal. When stations are at the
%      end-points of segments, the normal vector is undefined as it depends
%      on whether to use the prior or subsequent segment, or some
%      combination of these.
%
%      Note that the very first point always uses projections from the
%      following segement, and the very last point always uses the prior.
%      Otherwise, the flag determines behaviors for endpoints of internal
%      segments. The options include:
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 1;  % This is the default, and indicates
%          that the orthogonal projection of an endpoint is created by the
%          PRIOR segment leading up to each station query point.
% 
%          flag_rounding_type = 2;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projection of an endpoint is created by the FOLLOWING segment
%          after each station query point.
% 
%          flag_rounding_type = 3;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projection, ONLY if the station query falls at the joining point
%          between two segments (e.g. is on the "joint"), then the
%          projection is created by averaging the vector projections
%          created from the PRIOR segment and FOLLOWING segment.
% 
%          flag_rounding_type = 4;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projections along segments should be calculated at the midpoints
%          of each segment, and then for each station qeuary, the vector
%          projections are interpolated from their prior and subsequent
%          vectors.
%
%      figure_number: figure number where results are plotted
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%      closest_path_point: a 1x2 or 1x3 vector containing the [X Y] or [X Y
%      Z] location of the nearest point on the path
%
%      s_coordinate: a scalar (1x1) representing the s-coordinate distance
%      along the path
%
%      first_path_point_index: a scalar (1x1) representing the index of the
%      starting "row" of the path where the closest point landed.
%
%      second_path_point_index: a scalar (1x1) representing the index of the
%      ending "row" of the path where the closest point landed.
%
%      percent_along_length: a scalar (1x1) of the percent along the
%      segment of the path where the closest point landed.

% This function is used to convert a point's location into an imaginary
% distance, where the real portion of the distance represents the distance in
% the direction of a given unit vector, and the imaginary portion of the
% distance represents the orthogonal component. The conversion assumes a
% coordinate orientation of the Re/Im plane such that the real axis is
% aligned with the given unit projection vector representing the real axis.
%
% The reason for this function is that, when snapping a point onto a
% reference traversal, there are situations - particularly before the start
% of the traversal, after the end of the traversal, and along sharp corners
% of the traversal, where the point cannot be correctly represented solely
% by the orthogonal projection distance. For example, in sharp corners, the
% orthogonal projection is undefined and must be chosen by the user. The
% conversion of orthogonal distance thus allows correct and invertible
% converstions from path offsets in XY to Sy representations, and vice
% versa.
