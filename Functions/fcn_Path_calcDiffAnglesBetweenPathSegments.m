function diff_angles = fcn_Path_calcDiffAnglesBetweenPathSegments(Path,varargin)
% fcn_Path_calcDiffAnglesBetweenSegments
% Calculates the change in angles between path segments. If there are N
% points in the path, there are N-1 segments and thus N-2 angles between
% segments.
%
% Note that this method uses the dot product and the cross product to avoid
% errors caused by angle rollover that occur with arctan calculations. The
% arctan calculation gives the wrong answer with path segments are pointed
% near or at the -180 degree crossover point.
%
% FORMAT: 
%
%       diff_angles = fcn_Path_calcDiffAnglesBetweenPathSegments(Path,(fig_num))
%
% INPUTS:
%
%      Path: an N x 2 vector with [X Y] data in each row. N must be >= 3.
%
%      (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%
%      fig_num: a figure number to plot results.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%      diff_angles: tan (N-2) x 1 vector of the change in angles in radians
%
% DEPENDENCIES
%
%      (none)

% Note that this method uses the dot product and the cross product to avoid

% calculating angles, which works in general but fails for paths that point

% calculation. For example, the following code does NOT always work:
%
%     % angles = atan2(path_average(2:end,2)-path_average(1:end-1,2),path_average(2:end,1)-path_average(1:end-1,1));
%     % angles = [angles; angles(end)];  % Pad the last point twice
%     % diff_angles2 = abs(diff(angles));

b_vector = Path(3:end,:)-Path(2:end-1,:);

a_cross_b = crossProduct(a_vector,b_vector);
