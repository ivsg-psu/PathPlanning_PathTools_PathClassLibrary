% fcn_Path_findPathOrthogonalVectors
% Given a central traversal, finds the orthogonal vectors of that
% traversal. Includes special flag input to define the meaning of
% orthogonal vectors at verticies and ends, as these may not match the
% midpoint vectors. If the input path is in 3D, the orthogonal vectors are
% not clearly defined and the projection is ONLY done in XY space, leaving
% the z-component of the projection as zero.

% FORMAT:

%        fcn_Path_findPathOrthogonalVectors(path,...
%        (flag_rounding_type),(fig_num));
%
% INPUTS:
%
%      path: a path type input (N x 2 or N x 3) that specifies the path
%      geometry.
%
%      (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%      flag_rounding_type: a flag to indicate which type of projection is
%      used, especially when stations are located at the end-points of
%      segments within the nearby_traversal. When stations are at the
%      end-points of segments, the normal vector is undefined as it depends
%      on whether to use the prior or subsequent segment, or some
%      combination of these.
%
%      Note that the very first point always uses projections from the
%      following segement, and the very last point always uses the prior.
%      Otherwise, the flag determines behaviors for endpoints of internal
%      segments. The options include:
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 1;  % This is the default, and indicates
%          that the orthogonal projection of an endpoint is created by the
%          PRIOR segment leading up to each station query point.
% 
%          flag_rounding_type = 2;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projection of an endpoint is created by the FOLLOWING segment
%          after each station query point.
% 
%          flag_rounding_type = 3;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projection, ONLY if the station query falls at the joining point
%          between two segments (e.g. is on the "joint"), then the
%          projection is created by averaging the vector projections
%          created from the PRIOR segment and FOLLOWING segment.
% 
%          flag_rounding_type = 4;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projections along segments should be calculated at the midpoints
%          of each segment, and then for each station qeuary, the vector
%          projections are interpolated from their prior and subsequent
%          vectors.
%
%      fig_num: a figure number to plot results. Turns debugging on.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%      normal_unit_vectors_at_midpoints: the unit Nx2 vector that is
%      the normal projection of the segements at the midpoints.
%
%      normal_unit_vectors_at_joints: the unit (N+1)x2 vector that is
%      the normal projection of the segements at the joints. There are N+1
%      joints because, for a N segment path, there are N-1 joints and the
%      starting and ending points are also joints.

%% Find the joint tangent vectors for all joints in the central path 
% The joint projection vector for each joint will depend on the input
% options. For options where the orthogonal projection only uses the prior
% or subsequent values, we can use the previously calculated vectors. For
% options where averaging is occuring, we use averages of vectors.
% 
% Note that the start and end points are considered "joints" also, so if
% there are N segments, then there are N+1 joints.
% 
% Here's the rounding options:
%      flag_rounding_type = 1;  % This is the default, and indicates that
%      the orthogonal projection at a joint is created by the PRIOR
%      segment.
%
%      flag_rounding_type = 2;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%      projection at a joint is created by the FOLLOWING segment.
%
%      flag_rounding_type = 3;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%      projection, ONLY at a joint, is created by averaging both the
%      PRIOR segment and FOLLOWING segment.
%
%      flag_rounding_type = 4;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%      projections at the joint is created by averaging. Additionally,
%      along the entire segment, vectors should be calculated by
%      interpolating between the midpoint and the joint vectors.
