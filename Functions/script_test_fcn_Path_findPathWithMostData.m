% script_test_fcn_Path_findPathWithMostData.m
% tests function: fcn_Path_findPathWithMostData.m

% Revision history
% 2020_11_10
% -- first write of the code
% 2021_01_07
% -- renamed function to change paths to traversals
% 2020_01_09
% -- added more comments during clean-up
% 2025_07_01 - S. Brennan
% -- Removed traversal input type and replaced with cell array of paths
% -- Renamed function from fcn_Path_findTraversalWithMostData

%% BASIC Example: finding longest traversal
fig_num = 10001;
titleString = sprintf('BASIC Example: finding longest path');
fprintf(1,'Figure %.0f: %s\n',fig_num, titleString);

% Call the function that fills in sample paths (as a starter)
paths = fcn_Path_fillSamplePaths;

% Convert paths to path structures
clear cellArrayOfPaths; cellArrayOfPaths = cell(3,1);

% Call the function

% Update title

% Check variable types

% Check variable sizes
assert(isequal(size(index_of_longest),[1 1]));

% Check variable values

fprintf(1,'The longest path of the %.0d paths was path %.0d with %.0d elements\n',length(cellArrayOfPaths),index_of_longest,length(cellArrayOfPaths{index_of_longest}(:,1)));

% Make sure plot opened up
