%% fcn_Path_findCenterlineVoteFromTraversalToTraversal
% Given a "from" traversal and a "to" traversal, the method is to
% orthogonally project from the "from" traversal to find the distance to
% the "to" traversal at each station in the "from" traversal. For
% situations where the projection does not hit anything, the nearest
% neighbor is used that has a hit. The projection distances are then
% divided in half to find the apparent centerline measured via the "from"
% traersal. As well, the orthogonal unit vectors for each projection are
% returned. The function allows the user to specify the flag_rounding_type
% and search_radius.

%     fcn_Path_findCenterlineVoteFromTraversalToTraversal(...
%     from_traversal,to_traversal,(flag_rounding_type),(search_radius),(fig_num))
%
% INPUTS:
%
%      from_traversal: a traversal type wherein the projections are
%      calculated "from".
%
%      to_traversal: a traversal type wherein the projections are
%      calculated "to", to determine the distances "from".
%
%      (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%      flag_rounding_type: a flag to indicate which type of projection is
%      used, especially when stations are located at the end-points of
%      segments within the nearby_traversal. When stations are at the
%      end-points of segments, the normal vector is undefined as it depends
%      on whether to use the prior or subsequent segment, or some
%      combination of these.
%
%      Note that the very first point always uses projections from the
%      following segement, and the very last point always uses the prior.
%      Otherwise, the flag determines behaviors for endpoints of internal
%      segments. The options include:
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 1;  % This is the default, and indicates
%          that the orthogonal projection of an endpoint is created by the
%          PRIOR segment leading up to each station query point.
% 
%          flag_rounding_type = 2;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projection of an endpoint is created by the FOLLOWING segment
%          after each station query point.
% 
%          flag_rounding_type = 3;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projection, ONLY if the station query falls at the joining point
%          between two segments (e.g. is on the "joint"), then the
%          projection is created by averaging the vector projections
%          created from the PRIOR segment and FOLLOWING segment.
% 
%          flag_rounding_type = 4;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projections along segments should be calculated at the midpoints
%          of each segment, and then for each station qeuary, the vector
%          projections are interpolated from their prior and subsequent
%          vectors. For the endpoints - the start and end - the vectors are
%          aligned with the endpoints in the negative and positive
%          directions, respectively.
%
%      search_radius: the distance to project "from" to search for
%      intersections with the "to" traversal (default is 10 meters).
% 
%      flag_project_full_distance: this is a flag to determine whether the
%      projection is to the halfway distance between 1 and 2. For the
%      following values:
%
%          flag_project_full_distance = 0 (default): In this case, the returned path
%          is the halfway distance from 1 to 2, resulting in
%          the function returning the centerline between 1 and 2 as
%          measured from path 1.
%
%          flag_project_full_distance = 1: In this case, the returned path
%          is the full distance between 1 and 2, resulting in the function
%          returning the projection of path 1 onto 2.
%
%      fig_num: figure number where results are plotted
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%      centerline_points_projected: a Mx2 or Mx3 vector containing the [X
%      Y (Z)] locations of the projected centerline, one for each station
%      point in the "from" traversal.
%
%      unit_vectors_orthogonal: vectors at each centerline point that are
%      unit vectors orthogonal to the projection used in the "from"
%      traversal.
