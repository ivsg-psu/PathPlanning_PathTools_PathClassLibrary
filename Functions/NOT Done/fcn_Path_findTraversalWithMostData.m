function  index_of_longest = fcn_Path_findTraversalWithMostData(data, varargin)
% fcn_Path_findTraversalWithMostData.m
% finds the traversal index with the most amount of data (determined as the
% most elements in the X array)
%
% FORMAT: 
%
%      index_of_longest = fcn_Path_findTraversalWithMostData(data)
%
% INPUTS:
%
%      data: a structure containing subfields of X in the
%      following form
%           data.traversal{i_path}.X
%      Note that i_path denotes an array of paths. Each path will be
%      compared separately
%
%     (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%
%     fig_num: a figure number to plot results. If set to -1, skips any
%     input checking or debugging, no figures will be generated, and sets
%     up code to maximize speed. As well, if given, this forces the
%     variable types to be displayed as output and as well makes the input
%     check process verbose.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%      index: the index of the traversal with the most data
%
% DEPENDENCIES:
%
%      fcn_DebugTools_checkInputsToFunctions
%
% EXAMPLES:
%      
%       See the script: script_test_fcn_Path_findTraversalWithMostData.m
%       for a full test suite.
