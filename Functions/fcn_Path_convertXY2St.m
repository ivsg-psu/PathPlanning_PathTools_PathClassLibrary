function St_points = fcn_Path_convertXY2St(referencePath,XY_points, varargin)
%% fcn_Path_convertXY2St
% Given a referencePath (N x 2) and a set of XY_points (N x 2), returns the
% Station-transverse coordinates that represent the XY points. Note: this
% function is essentially a streamlined version of
% fcn_Path_snapPointToPathViaVectors. For points snapped at verticies, the
% results may be a complex number where the real portion of the number is
% the distance along the flag_rounding_type projection vector, and the
% imaginary portion is the complex portion. The angle of the point relative
% to the vertex can be found using the complex vector angle.
% 
% FORMAT: 
%
%    St_points = fcn_Path_convertXY2St(referencePath,XY_points,
%    (flag_rounding_type), (fig_num));
%
% INPUTS:
%
%      referencePath: a Nx2 or Nx3 vector of [X Y (Z)] path points, where N
%      is the number of points the points on the path, with N >= 2.
%
%      XY_points: a Mx2 vector containing the [X Y] location of the points
%      or a Mx3 vector containing the [X Y Z] location of the points to
%      convert, where M is the number of rows of different points
%
%      (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%      flag_rounding_type: a flag to indicate which type of projection is
%      used, especially when stations are located at the end-points of
%      segments within the nearby_traversal. When stations are at the
%      end-points of segments, the normal vector is undefined as it depends
%      on whether to use the prior or subsequent segment, or some
%      combination of these.
%
%      Note that the very first point always uses projections from the
%      following segement, and the very last point always uses the prior.
%      Otherwise, the flag determines behaviors for endpoints of internal
%      segments. The options include:
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 1;  % This is the default, and indicates
%          that the orthogonal projection of an endpoint is created by the
%          PRIOR segment leading up to each station query point.
% 
%          flag_rounding_type = 2;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projection of an endpoint is created by the FOLLOWING segment
%          after each station query point.
% 
%          flag_rounding_type = 3;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projection, ONLY if the station query falls at the joining point
%          between two segments (e.g. is on the "joint"), then the
%          projection is created by averaging the vector projections
%          created from the PRIOR segment and FOLLOWING segment.
% 
%          flag_rounding_type = 4;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projections along segments should be calculated at the midpoints
%          of each segment, and then for each station qeuary, the vector
%          projections are interpolated from their prior and subsequent
%          vectors. For the endpoints - the start and end - the vectors are
%          aligned with the endpoints in the negative and positive
%          directions, respectively.
%
%      fig_num: figure number where results are plotted
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%      St_points: a Mx2 or Mx3 vector containing the [S t] or [S t h]
%      coordinates corresponding to each [ X Y (Z)] input point.
