% fcn_Path_snapPointToPathViaVectors
% Finds location on a path that is closest to a given query point, e.g.
% snapping the point onto the path. This function is similar to
% fcn_Path_snapPointOntoNearestPath and gives the same outputs; however, it
% uses a vector calculation method rather than point-distance metric. This
% improves robustness.
%
% The solution method is as follows:
%  1. Find the unit orthogonal vectors of each path segment
%  2. Project from the end of each segment to the query point(s), creating
%  two vectors per segment, one at each end-point of each segment, pointing
%  to each query point.
%  3. Take the cross product of the point-projection vectors at each end of
%  a line segment with the orthogonal projection vector for the segment.
%  4. If the cross-product signs change, then the point must be within the
%  orthogonal projection of the line segment. For these cases, calculate
%  the dot product of the orthogonal projection with one of the point
%  projection vectors to find the distance to the point. Keep the minimimum
%  distance among all segments, save the segment indicies, percent along
%  length, etc.
%  5. There are cases where a point is at the vertex of a segment, and not
%  within the projection of the line segment. To query these cases, find
%  the distance of the query point to all points in the line segment,
%  keeping the minimum. If the minimum distance to a vertex is less than
%  any of the minimum distances to segment projections, use this distance,
%  keep the vertex as the segment indicies, set percent along length to
%  zero, and calculate real/imaginary components depending on the
%  projection type.

%
% INPUTS:
%
%      points: a Mx2 vector containing the [X Y] location of the point or
%              a Mx3 vector containing the [X Y Z] location of the point
%              where M is the number of rows of different points
%
%      path: a Nx2 or Nx3 vector of [X Y (Z)] path points, where N is the
%      number of points the points on the path, with N >= 2.
%
%      (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%      flag_rounding_type: a flag to indicate which type of projection is
%      used, especially when stations are located at the end-points of
%      segments within the nearby_traversal. When stations are at the
%      end-points of segments, the normal vector is undefined as it depends
%      on whether to use the prior or subsequent segment, or some
%      combination of these.
%
%      Note that the very first point always uses projections from the
%      following segement, and the very last point always uses the prior.
%      Otherwise, the flag determines behaviors for endpoints of internal
%      segments. The options include:
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 1;  % This is the default, and indicates
%          that the orthogonal projection of an endpoint is created by the
%          PRIOR segment leading up to each station query point.
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 2;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projection of an endpoint is created by the FOLLOWING segment
%          after each station query point.
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 3;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projection, ONLY if the station query falls at the joining point
%          between two segments (e.g. is on the "joint"), then the
%          projection is created by averaging the vector projections
%          created from the PRIOR segment and FOLLOWING segment.
%
%          flag_rounding_type = 4;  % This indicates that the orthogonal
%          projections along segments should be calculated at the midpoints
%          of each segment, and then for each station qeuary, the vector
%          projections are interpolated from their prior and subsequent
%          vectors. For the endpoints - the start and end - the vectors are
%          aligned with the endpoints in the negative and positive
%          directions, respectively.
%
%      figure_number: figure number where results are plotted
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%      closest_path_points: a Mx2 or Mx3 vector containing the [X Y] or [X Y
%      Z] location of the nearest point on the path
%
%      s_coordinate: a scalar (Mx1) representing the s-coordinate distance
%      along the path. Negative values indicate distances "before" the path
%      starts, measured from the projection of the first path segment.
%      Similarly, values larger than the total path length represent
%      distances "after" the path ends, measured from the projection of the
%      last path segment.
%
%      first_path_point_indicies: a scalar (Mx1) representing the index of the
%      starting "row" of the path where the closest point landed.
%
%      second_path_point_indicies: a scalar (Mx1) representing the index of the
%      ending "row" of the path where the closest point landed.
%
%      percent_along_length: a scalar (Mx1) of the percent along the
%      segment of the path where the closest point landed. Values less than
%      zero represent locations before a path starts, and values above 1
%      represent locations after the path ends.

        % This function is used to convert a point's location into an imaginary
        % distance, where the real portion of the distance represents the distance in
        % the direction of a given unit vector, and the imaginary portion of the
        % distance represents the orthogonal component. The conversion assumes a
        % coordinate orientation of the Re/Im plane such that the real axis is
        % aligned with the given unit projection vector representing the real axis.
        %
        % The reason for this function is that, when snapping a point onto a
        % reference traversal, there are situations - particularly before the start
        % of the traversal, after the end of the traversal, and along sharp corners
        % of the traversal, where the point cannot be correctly represented solely
        % by the orthogonal projection distance. For example, in sharp corners, the
        % orthogonal projection is undefined and must be chosen by the user. The
        % conversion of orthogonal distance thus allows correct and invertible
        % converstions from path offsets in XY to Sy representations, and vice
        % versa.
