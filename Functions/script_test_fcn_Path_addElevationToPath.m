% This is a script to exercise the function: fcn_Path_addElevationToPath.m
% This function was written on 2021_03_06 by Satya Prasad, szm888@psu.edu

% Revision history:
% 2021_03_20 - by S. Brennan
% - Added another example that is a bit more clearly "above" the query!
% 2024_03_14 - by S. Brennan
% - Fixed bug with 3D vectors not working right
% NOTE: the results do not seem to be correct!
